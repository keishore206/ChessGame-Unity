# ChessGame-Unity
The 2d chess game in using unity

Chess Possible Moves Calculator

This project focuses on calculating and highlighting all possible legal moves for a selected chess piece on a chessboard using Unity. When a chess piece is selected, the valid movement cells are highlighted in green, and the movement path is correctly blocked if another chess piece is present in the path. The project strictly follows the given requirements by implementing only the move-highlighting logic without actual piece movement. Emphasis is placed on clean coding style, object-oriented programming principles, and maintainable script structure rather than UI/UX design.
